# *SB-TemPsy*
*SB-TemPsy* (**S**ignal-**B**ased **Tem**poral **P**roperty made ea**sy**) is an offline trace-checking approach for checking signal-based temporal properties over execution traces.

*SB-TemPsy* is composed of:
  - `SBTemPsy-DSL`; a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for specification of signal-based temporal properties.
  - `SBTemPsy-Check`; an automated offline procedure for checking `SBTemPsy-DSL` properties on execution traces.

`SB-TemPsy-Check` tool has been developed by [Chaima Boufaied](https://wwwfr.uni.lu/snt/people/chaima_boufaied) and [Claudio Menghi](https://wwwfr.uni.lu/snt/people/claudio_menghi), at the [SVV](https://wwwen.uni.lu/snt/research/software_verification_and_validation_lab/) lab of the [University of Luxembourg](https://wwwen.uni.lu/)
under the supervision of [Domenico Bianculli](https://wwwen.uni.lu/snt/people/domenico_bianculli) and [Lionel Briand](https://wwwen.uni.lu/snt/people/lionel_briand).

*SB-TemPsy* is presented in the following paper

We plan to release the source code of *SB-TemPsy* under a FOSS license (we expect to receive the final decision by our legal team in January 2021)
